/*
    Given an ArrayList of words switch position for
    each pair in the List. A pair is an element and
    the element next to it.
    The given ArrayList will always have an even
    number of elements so each element will
    always have a single pair
Changing the order of the pairs
    Ex:
    Input: {"Cat", "in", "the", "hat"}
    There is two pairs:
    "Cat" and "in"
    "the" and "hat"
    Output: {"in", "Cat", "hat",
    "the‚Äù}
