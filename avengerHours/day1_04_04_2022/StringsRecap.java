/*
String - object type, sequence of chars
String class is a member of java.lang. No need to import
There are 2 way to create string object:
1- String literal : Syntax: String str = "Apple";
created in string pool in heap memory
2 - new keyword - String str2 = new String ("Apple");
created in heap memory, directly
*Both are same in terms of usage, but only differs for memory allocation

String is immutable (unchangeable/unmodifiable)
